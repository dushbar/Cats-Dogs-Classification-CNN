# Cats-Dogs-Classification-CNN
Classification using CNN

We create a CNN architecture to build a model which is trained on a labelled dataset consisting of images of dogs and cats.
We first use the tanh activation function throughout except for the output layer.
We observe overfitting so we use early stopping.
